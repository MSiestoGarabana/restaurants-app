# Restaurants App

Small single page application made as part of the "Welkhome techÂ´s" technical test for a junior frontend positon.
The user can choose from a list of restaurants and select a date and time to make a reservation. If there is a reservation made, information with the reservation data will be displayed and a button to cancel the reservation will be shown.

## MUI

This exercise has been a good opportunity to review the MUI component library, which I had started to use before my programming bootcamp (in which we focused mainly on Bootstrap).

## react-datepicker // date-fns

On the other hand, I had the opportunity to get to know react-datepicker and date-fns. Great libraries to manage calendars and dates.
I had never worked with calendars before and I am quite proud of the result.

## jest

Unfortunately I have not succeeded at integrating testing of my components with Jest, due to an incompatibility that I was unaware of between Vite and Jest. I have inquired about the matter and it seems that the best option to solve it is to use Vite's own tool, Vitest.

However I am quite happy with the result and with what I have learned during this development.
